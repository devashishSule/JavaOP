Java Concecpts:

1. Method Overloading: 
    Same method name, different parameters used.
    Takes place in same class.
    e.g AttackOnTitan.java in this repository

2. Method Overriding: 
    Same method name. 
    No parameters required to execute.
    Takes place in different classes but these classes should be inherited.
    e.g meth_overriden.java in this repository

3. Super keyword: 
    Calls the parameters from the parent class.
    e.g super_keyword.java in this repository

4. Constructor: 
    Whenever an object is created, Constructor is invoked.
    Constructor name is same as class name.
    e.g BMI.java in this repository                 

5. Dynamic Method Dispatch (DMD):
    Here, we have to create an object reference of an parent class inorder to call the
    objects of the inherited class. Method is overriden in inherited class from parent class.
    e.g in detailed is in dmd.java in this repository

6. Abstract class:
    A class is declared as abstract using abstract keyword. It cannot be instantialised.
    It can be suclassed. It may or may not contain abstract methods.Yo can only create 
    abstract methods here but cannot define them.
    e.g in abs_class.java file in this repository 

7. Inheritance:
